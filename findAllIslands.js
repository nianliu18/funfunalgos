/*
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically or even diagonally. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
const islands = [
 [1,0,1,0,1],
 [1,1,1,0,1],
 [0,0,0,0,1],
 [1,0,1,0,1],
 [1,0,1,1,1]
]
*/

/*
Before we start a little pseudo code:

â€¢ We know that we need to look out for all 8 directions North, East, South, West, North-East, North-West, South-East and lastely South-West in search for our islands. Once we know there are no more connections of islands (1's) we know we have an island thus increment a counter of some sort to keep track.
